Documentation
=============

Any new documentation will be formatted in ``.rst`` and added to this directory (with the exception of "man pages" explained below).

To enable RST linking, add the following directive at the top of the file:
   - ``.. _<file-name>``
   - Refer to any existing ``.rst`` files for formatting examples.

Man Page .RST File Formatting And Editing
-----------------------------------------

For any code or plugin-specific documentation (e.g., manual pages), please use the ``.rst`` format.

1. To edit existing man page ``.rst`` files, make changes within the ``ldms/`` directory where the corresponding code resides.
   - **Do not** edit or add files directly in the ``docs/rst_man/`` directory. This directory is where symlinks of the ``.rst`` man files under ``ldms/`` are created when building Read the Docs.
3. When creating a new man page, use the following naming convention: ``<group/category>-<plugin-type>_<plugin-name>.rst``
   - Example: ``ldms-sampler_my-plugin.rst`` OR ``ldmsd-store_my-plugin.rst``
   - For non-plugin files, include the type (e.g., ``ldms_/ldmsd_``) at the beginning of the filename.
4. To enable RST linking, add the following directive at the top of the file:
   - ``.. _my-plugin``
   - Refer to existing man page ``.rst`` files for formatting examples.
5. Please follow the standard man page ``.rst`` formatting by including the following information at the top:
        ===========
        <MY-PLUGIN>
        ===========

        ---------------------------------------------
        Description of my-plugin
        ---------------------------------------------

        :Date: YYYY-MM-DD
        :Version: vX.X
        :Manual section: X
        :Manual group: LDMS/LDMSD <plugin-type>

Test Your Changes
-----------------

There are multiple ways to preview your documentation changes before merging them. We recommend using a **personal Read the Docs account** for testing, as it allows you to view the rendered results without affecting the main project. However, testing through a **pull request** is useful when you want to see a side-by-side comparison using Read the Docs' "diff" feature.

Personal Readthedocs Account
............................

To visualize and test your documentation changes on the offical `OVIS LDMS Documentation page <https://ovis-hpc.readthedocs.io/projects/ldms/en/latest/>`_, you can set up your own RTD account.

1. **Fork the repository**: Fork the repository where the docs are located to your own GitHub account.
2. **Create a Read the Docs account**: Sign up for a free Read the Docs account at `readthedocs.org <https://readthedocs.org/>`_.
3. **Link the repository**:
    - After logging in, go to the **"Import a Project"** page on `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/projects/>`_.
    - Choose **"GitHub"** as the source and authorize Read the Docs to access your GitHub account.
    - Select your forked repository from the list.
4. **Specify the correct branch**:
    - In the project settings, you will be asked to specify the branch of your repository. Select the branch that contains the changes you've made to the documentation.
5. **Set the location of ``.readthedocs.yml``**:
    - Read the Docs will need to know where your ``.readthedocs.yml`` file is located. In the project settings, ensure that you specify the **current directory** (`./`) as the location of the ``.readthedocs.yml`` file.
    - The ``.readthedocs.yml`` file controls the configuration of your documentation build process on Read the Docs (including things like Python dependencies, versioning, and build steps).
6. **Build the documentation**: After linking the project and selecting the correct branch, Read the Docs will automatically build the documentation. You can view the generated docs at the provided URL.

This will allow you to see your changes in real-time as you push updates to the branch.

For a full walkthrough with screenshots, visit the `Read the Docs Tutorial <https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/tutorial/index.html#creating-a-read-the-docs-account>`_.

Using Local Machine
...................

The documentation can be built with ``make html`` or ``make man`` and the generated files will be found in the ``_build`` directory.
If you instead want to test a build on your local machine, please install the following depencencies before running ``make html``.

``` shell
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build
```

or, if you are using make:

``` shell
make html
```

.. note::

        Even if the documentation builds successfully, the final appearance (especially images, plots, or custom themes) may differ from the online version. Always check the rendered result on Read the Docs when possible.


Edits To Other Files
--------------------

If your changes affect the documentation build process itself (e.g. editing ``conf.py``, ``.readthedocs.yml``, or ``requirements.txt``), please submit a PR as usual. An admin or maintainer will review the changes to ensure compatibility with the build system.
